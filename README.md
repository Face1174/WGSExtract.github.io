We use the Facebook group [Dante Labs and Nebula Genomics Customers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/) for discussions on how to make use of your **Direct-to-Consumer(DTC) 30x Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) test** results. Bugs, use cases and announcements about this tool happen there.  As part of that groups Files section, you will find a number of useful companion documents and tool references.  In particular, start with [Bioinformatics for Newbies](http://bit.ly/38jnxnK). This tool is geared toward the needs of [genetic genealogy](https://h600.org/wiki/Genetic+Genealogy) but may be helpful for this looking into health-releated uses of WHS tests. The sub-$500, DTC 30x WGS tests are delivered with their basic data files and maybe some health-related reports. This tool serves to fill the gap in linking the results to the needs of the [genetic genealogy](https://h600.org/wiki/Genetic+Genealogy) community.

Further documentation is available in our [WGS Extract Developer's Documentation Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/tree/master/docs).

The original, first year, [historical release is documented here](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical).

This page is located at https://WGSExtract.github.io/ and serves as the new WWW home for the tool. Once the new version without the reference models is released for distribution here, the historical IP-number site link will go away. The current manual short link of http://bit.ly/36Jdpnq will be redirected to this page as a more permanent link as well. Discussion for users will continue to be supported in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/).
