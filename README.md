You may find the Facebook [Dante Labs and Nebula Genomics Customers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/) group useful for discussions on this and other tools that make use of your 30x WGS test results. Bugs, use cases and announcements about this tool are made there.  As part of the Files section, you can find a number of useful companion documents and tool references.  In particular, start with [Bioinformatics for Newbies](http://bit.ly/38jnxnK)

Further documentation is available in our [WGS Extract Developer's Documentation Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/tree/master/docs)

Developer's should visit the main GitHub [WGS Extract Developers Code Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/)

:memo:`**Note**`: The tool acronym is **WGSE** and pronounced as "wig-see". We encourage this use in English conversation.

This page is located at https://WGSExtract.github.io/ and serves as the new home on the WWW for the tool. Once the new version without the reference models included is released, the old site link at http://37.187.22.93/wgsextract/ will go away. The current manual short link of http://bit.ly/36Jdpnq will be redirected here at that time and serves as a more permanent link as well. Discussion for users will continue to be supported in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/).
