We use the Facebook group [Dante Labs and Nebula Genomics Customers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/) for discussions on how to make use of your **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) 30x Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) test** results. Bugs, use cases and announcements about this tool happen there.  As part of that groups Files section, you will find a number of useful companion documents and tool references.  In particular, start with [Bioinformatics for Newbies](http://bit.ly/38jnxnK). This tool is geared toward the needs of [genetic genealogy](https://h600.org/wiki/Genetic+Genealogy) but may be helpful for this looking into health-releated uses of WGS tests. The **sub-$500, DTC 30x WGS tests** are delivered with their basic data files and often some health-related reports. This tool serves to fill-in the gap by linking the WGS file results to the [genetic genealogy community tools](https://h600.org/wiki/Third+Party+Analysis+Tools).

User issues, if not brought up in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/), should be raised in the [issues section of this site](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract.github.io/issues).

The tool acronym is **WGSE** and is pronounced as "wig-see". We encourage this use in English language onversation.

Further documentation beyond the manual link above is available in our [WGS Extract Developer's Documentation Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/tree/master/docs).

Developer's should visit the main GitHub [WGS Extract Developers Code Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/).  Development issues, code bugs and limitations should be [raised in the development issues section](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/issues) so they are tracked till resolved in a release.

The original, first year, [historical release is documented here](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical).

This page is located at https://WGSExtract.github.io/ and serves as the new WWW home for the tool. Once the new version without the reference models is released for distribution here, the historical IP-number site link will go away. The current manual short link of http://bit.ly/36Jdpnq will be redirected to this page as a more permanent link as well. As the need develops, we will create our own Facebook Group for users to raise issues outside of the [User Issues Section](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract.github.io/issues) section already mentioned.
